        <div class="bio bio1">
          <p>
            An only child, Momoa was born in 1979 in Nānākuli, Honolulu, Hawaii
            to Coni (Lemke), a photographer and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His
            father is of partial Native Hawaiian ancestry and his mother is of
            German, Irish, and Native American descent. He was raised in
            Norwalk, Iowa, by his mother.

            Momoa began a relationship with actress Lisa Bonet in 2005. Although
            it was previously believed that Momoa and Bonet married on November
            15, 2007, the couple did not marry until October 2017. Through his
            marriage to Bonet, Momoa is the stepfather to Zoë Kravitz, Bonet's
            daughter with ex-husband, musician Lenny Kravitz. In July 2007,
            Bonet gave birth to their first child, a daughter. Their second
            child, a son, was born in December 2008.

            Momoa has numerous tattoos, including a halfsleeve on his left
            forearm, a tribute to his family god, or "aumakua". He participated
            in protests against the building of the Thirty Meter Telescope on
            Mauna Kea, a holy spiritual site for native Hawaiians.

            On November 15, 2008, Momoa was slashed across the face with a
            broken beer glass during an altercation at the Birds Cafe, a tavern
            in Hollywood, California. He received approximately 140 stitches
            during reconstructive surgery and the scar through his left eyebrow
            is apparent in his later work. The assailant was sentenced to five
            years in prison for the attack.
